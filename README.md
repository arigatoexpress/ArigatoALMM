Full Sail DEXFull Sail is a next-generation Decentralized Exchange (DEX) on the Sui blockchain, engineered from the ground up to maximize Return on Emissions (ROE) and create the most capital-efficient and sustainable AMM ever designed.Incubated by Aftermath Finance and backed by the Sui Foundation, Full Sail moves beyond the incremental improvements of existing ve(3,3) models to pioneer a new, more efficient paradigm we call ve(4,4).Table of ContentsThe Full Sail Innovation: Solving the Core Problems of Modern DEXsCore FeaturesTechnical ArchitectureGetting StartedLicenseThe Full Sail Innovation: Solving the Core Problems of Modern DEXsToday's leading DEXs, while innovative, suffer from systemic flaws: misaligned tokenomics, inefficient emissions, reflexive sell pressure, and cumbersome governance. Full Sail addresses each of these issues with targeted solutions:ProblemFull Sail's SolutionMassive Airdrops & DilutionStrategic Initial Distribution. No massive airdrop. Early LPs are rewarded with a "best price guarantee" and boosted yield for locking liquidity, turning a spend into a long-term investment.Inefficient EmissionsConcentrated Liquidity & Dynamic Fees. Built on a CLAMM from day one, ensuring higher fees per dollar of liquidity and maximizing capital efficiency.Boring, Non-Strategic VotingResponsive Organized Weighting (ROW). A weekly PvP voting game where users predict a pool's volume. Emissions are adjusted based on collective accuracy, directly tying rewards to revenue generation.The "Great Unlock" & InflationInsurance Fund & oSAIL. A portion of protocol fees builds a yield-generating insurance fund to manage unlock volatility. Emissions are paid in oSAIL (an options token), giving LPs the choice to lock for full value or cash out at a discount that benefits the protocol.Mercenary Capital & BribesBribes for Liquidity Locking. Bribes are redirected to LPs in exchange for locking their Position NFTs, providing transparent, long-term liquidity security for all participants.Core FeaturesConcentrated Liquidity AMM (CLAMM): Allows LPs to concentrate their capital in specific price ranges, dramatically increasing capital efficiency.Dynamic Fee Tiers: Different pools can be created with different fee tiers (e.g., 0.05%, 0.30%, 1.00%), allowing fees to be optimized for different asset pairs.ve(4,4) Tokenomics: A novel system built around the SAIL and oSAIL tokens to align long-term incentives between LPs, traders, and the protocol.On-Chain TWAP Oracle: Every pool provides a reliable, manipulation-resistant Time-Weighted Average Price oracle for other protocols to build upon.Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL): A core strategy to build a sustainable liquidity foundation and reduce reliance on mercenary capital.Technical ArchitectureThe Full Sail protocol is built on a modular and secure foundation using Sui Move. The core engine is a sophisticated Concentrated Liquidity AMM.Core Modulesmy_dex::pool: The main module that defines the Pool, Position, and AdminCap structs. It handles all core logic for swaps, liquidity provisioning, and fee collection.my_dex::math_lib: A dedicated library for all fixed-point arithmetic required for price, tick, and liquidity calculations. (Note: This must be implemented with a professionally audited library).my_dex::tick_manager & my_dex::bitmap: Helper modules that manage tick data and provide gas-efficient lookups for active liquidity, preventing DoS attacks and reducing swap costs.On-Chain ObjectsAdminCap: A unique capability object required to create new pools and collect protocol fees, securing the treasury.Pool: A shared object representing a single liquidity pool for a specific token pair and fee tier.Position (NFT): An owned object that represents a user's unique liquidity position, tracking its price range, liquidity amount, and earned fees.Getting StartedThis repository contains the core smart contracts for the Full Sail DEX.Prerequisites:Sui CLIMove Language Extension for your IDEBuild & Test:# Clone the repository
